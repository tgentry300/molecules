We have made all possible combinations of rectangles.

We need to figure out how to try 4 strings around rectangle.

Check index of strings at height value and see if they match.

Check 3 to 10 indices
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Horizontal strings, 2 vertical strings
maximize the crosswordyness of the rectangles

need intersecting letters, and maximum rectangle area

set of constraints

start with set square size, if it doesn't fit, discard rectangle.

need list of possible size rectangles
